# Window type settings
# 
# 'WINDOW_TYPE' is one of the 15 window types defined in EWMH standard: 
#     "unknown", "desktop", "dock", "toolbar", "menu", "utility", 
#     "splash", "dialog", "normal", "dropdown_menu", "popup_menu", 
#     "tooltip", "notification", "combo", and "dnd".
# 
# Following per window-type options are available: ::
# 
#   fade, shadow:::
#     Controls window-type-specific shadow and fade settings.
# 
#   opacity:::
#     Controls default opacity of the window type.
# 
#   focus:::
#     Controls whether the window of this type is to be always considered focused. 
#     (By default, all window types except "normal" and "dialog" has this on.)
# 
#   full-shadow:::
#     Controls whether shadow is drawn under the parts of the window that you 
#     normally won't be able to see. Useful when the window has parts of it 
#     transparent, and you want shadows in those areas.
# 
#   redir-ignore:::
#     Controls whether this type of windows should cause screen to become 
#     redirected again after been unredirected. If you have unredir-if-possible
#     set, and doesn't want certain window to cause unnecessary screen redirection, 
#     you can set this to `true`.
